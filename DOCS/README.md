#### Governing Equations for combustion

This simulation code solves the fully compressible Navier-Stocks equations with energy and species conservation equations are considered in the governing equations.

### Governing equations in the Cartesian coordinate
In the planar flame simulations, the one-dimensional Navier-Stocks equations in the conservative form in the Cartesian coordinate are written as:

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial(E-E_\nu)}{\partial x}=S \\
$$



$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
